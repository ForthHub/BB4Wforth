				BB4Wforth
				---------

INTRODUCTION

BB4Wforth is a Forth system for Microsoft Windows (Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000,
XP, Vista and Windows 7) which uses BBC BASIC as its input/output subsystem.
BB4Wforth has access to most of the I/O facilities of BBC BASIC, including
coloured text and graphics, buffered file input/output and 'OSCLI' commands.
In addition, BB4Wforth can access the Windows API and other DLLs, allowing
a Forth program to utilise Windows features such as GUI controls.  Knowledge
of BBC BASIC is not essential for using BB4Wforth, but it can be helpful.

BB4Wforth is based on Jonesforth (http://annexia.org/forth/).  Although the
original Jonesforth is rather non-standard, BB4Wforth incorporates several
corrections and additions to improve its compatibility with other Forths.
BB4Wforth versions 0.33 and later pass the Hayes CORE tests successfully.

BB4Wforth is supplied in both source form and as a self-contained Windows
executable.  The files in the BB4Wforth.zip archive are as follows:

  bb4wforth.txt		This help file
  bb4wforth.f		A modified and extended version of jonesforth.f 
  forth.bbc		The BBC BASIC source code (tokenised format)
  forth.bas		The BBC BASIC source code (plain text format)
  forth.exe		The Windows executable (requires no other files)
  fern.f		An example of graphical output
  hanoi.f		An example of coloured text output
  midi.f		An example of accessing the Windows API
  menu.f		An example of handling Windows events
  sieve.f		A Sieve of Eratosthenes benchmark
  tester.fr		The Hayes test harness (must be run first)
  core.fr		The Hayes CORE test suite (run after tester.fr)

To rebuild BB4Wforth from the source files requires the full version of
'BBC BASIC for Windows', details at http://www.bb4w.com/

OPERATION

When BB4Wforth is started it announces itself in a GUI window as follows:

  BB4Wforth version 0.38 adapted from Jonesforth version 47

  OK

At this point normal Forth commands and definitions may be entered.  To
read a Forth program from a file, such as one of the supplied examples,
enter the following:  S" filename" EXEC (or S" filename" INCLUDED) and
press the Enter (Return) key.  BB4Wforth is case sensitive.

To list the Forth programs in the 'current directory' enter DIR.  To see
what Forth words are already defined, enter WORDS.  To quit BB4Wforth
enter BYE (or click on the Close button).

You can alternatively execute a Forth program directly, by specifying
its name at a command prompt (or via a shortcut) as follows:

  forth progname.f

If you're not very familiar with Forth, there is a useful tutorial here:
http://www.murphywong.net/hello/simple.htm .  Most (but not all) of the
sample code listed there will run successfully in BB4Wforth.

FORTH WORDS

The following standard Forth words, present in Jonesforth but implemented
in a non-standard way, have been corrected in BB4Wforth: DEPTH  .S  /MOD
U.  ALLOT  CREATE  TRUE  HERE  FIND  WHILE  REPEAT  WORD  KEY

The following standard Forth words, absent from Jonesforth, have been
added in BB4Wforth: M*  UM*  */MOD  U/MOD  UM/MOD  SM/MOD  FM/MOD  D+  D-
ROLL  R@  DO  ?DO  I  J  LEAVE  UNLOOP  LOOP  +LOOP  <BUILDS  DOES>  ABS
MAX  MIN  PAGE  AT-XY  MS  TYPE  INCLUDED  [CHAR]  2OVER  CELL+  CHARS
